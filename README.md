# SVG Design

I created a cartoon version of my best friend's dog birthday party.  Everyone at the party fed her star shaped dog treats, hence the banner.

*Changes by Damon*

As a dog owner and *almost* vegetarian, I find myself caring a lot about the well-being of animals. This is why I wanted to take the original project and *incorporate an educational element* while maintaining the playful nature. Clicking on the bones leads to a page that answers whether or not dogs should be given bones to chew on.

Then, I multiplied the original **stars** and added transformations to them.
